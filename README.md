# EDUCATIONAL LSP

A Language Server built for the educational purpose of understanding **WHAT LSP is** and **HOW it works**.

It doesn't do anything special for any particular language; it is focused on helping you understand what your tools do and how to build a basic Language Server.

- **Minimal Implementation**: Focuses on the core concepts of LSP, making it easy to learn.
- **Protocol Exploration**: How client-server communication works in LSP.
- **Example Handlers**: Demonstrates how to implement basic LSP features such as:
  - Hover
  - Definitions
  - Code Actions
  - Completion
  - Diagnostics
